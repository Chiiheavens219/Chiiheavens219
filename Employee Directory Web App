# Conception - Creating Users and Groups

## Created an IAM User

I created an IAM user from the root account 

Created a group and labelled it Admin and then assigned Administrator access to the IAM User.

## Created 3 Users and 3 groups

I created user-1, user-2 and user-3

I further created 3 groups with permissions assigned to them which are:

S3 Support with ReadOnlyAccess

EC2 Support with ReadOnlyAccess

EC2 Admin with ViewStopStartAccess

user-1 and user-2 were assigned managed policies

user-3 was assigned an inline policy

## Testrunning the 3 users created
